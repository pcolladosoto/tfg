    The object of the proposed Undergraduate Thesis is the development of a software system automating the deployment and management of fully virtual networks for their use as a testbed. The project sits within the scope of the \textit{CloudWall} \cite{bib:react} project from the \textit{Automatics Department} at the \textit{University of Alcal√°}, whose main focus is to develop a Cloud-enabled Resilience Framework tailored for the needs of the healthcare IT infrastructures to increase their capability to prevent and react to cyber attacks. Its intended purpose is serving as a validation mechanism for the techniques developed within said project.\\

    The use of \textit{docker} containers as virtual network nodes together with the possibilities offered by the \textit{linux kernel} offer a huge amount of flexibility that we have respected and made available to the user. The logic implementing the network control functionalities has been written entirely with \textit{python3}. A proof of concept proving the project's suitability for its intended use is also provided. What is more, given the technologies the project has been built upon its use cases are much broader than what was initially required. We consider its possible use as a teaching resource to be one of the most promising future applications.\\
