    abstract = {Nowadays society is more and more dependent on critical infrastructures. Critical network infrastructures (CNI) are communication networks whose disruption can create a severe impact. In this paper we propose REACT, a distributed framework for reactive network resilience, which allows networks to reconfigure themselves in the event of a security incidents so that the risk of further damage is mitigated. Our framework takes advantage of a risk model based on multilayer networks, as well as a graph-coloring problem conversion, to identify new, more resilient configurations for networks in the event of an attack. We propose two different solution approaches, and evaluate them from two different perspectives, with a number of centralized optimization techniques. Experiments show that our approaches outperform the reference approaches in terms of risk mitigation and performance.}
